# **My Smart Home Projects**
I have ongoing projects with a goal to automate my home with the latest and best technologies. It makes our lives a little more convenient and a little more secure. It's also a fun learning experience for me too.

I found a slick way of using a mini-x86 box installed with the Ubuntu server distro to create a virtual combo keyboard/mouse/consumerControl bluetooth hid over gatt (HoG) ble 5.0 peripheral. It uses the linux's new baby brother Zephyr rtos (real time operating system) and an Ubuntu Posix shell to do this.

I've been using Logitechs Harmony Hub to control my entertainment center. It generally works ok but was sick of being forced to use their over-rated, over-priced remote controls. So I wrote this bridge so that any wired, ir, or wireless usb remote can be used to control ip, ir, or bluetooth devices. It works really well with a nice simple usb remote and I no longer need to use my Harmony Hub. It also integrates with HomeAssistant to control other smarthome devices besides entertainment equipment.
